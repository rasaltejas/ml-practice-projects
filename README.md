# 🌱 ML Projects – Learning Journey 2025

This repository tracks my hands‑on journey in Machine Learning as a 3rd year CSE (AI/ML) student from Mumbai, India.  
Each notebook focuses on understanding core ML concepts through small but complete experiments, with clean code and clear outputs.

## 📂 Current Projects

### 1. FlowerClassification.ipynb  
Classifies iris flowers into species using classical Machine Learning.

- Dataset: Iris flower dataset (`Iris.csv`) with sepal and petal measurements.  
- Goal: Predict the correct species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from 4 numeric features.  
- Techniques used:
  - Data loading and basic inspection with pandas  
  - Feature–label separation  
  - Logistic Regression classifier for multi‑class prediction  
  - Simple prediction on custom input to test the model  
- What this shows: Understanding of supervised learning, classification, and how to go from dataset → model → prediction in a single notebook.

## 🧠 What this repo represents

- A **practice space** where I regularly add new ML notebooks as I learn new algorithms and ideas.  
- Focus on **clarity over complexity**: each notebook is small, readable, and easy for others (recruiters, peers) to follow.  
- Built to grow into:
  - Regression, classification, clustering, and NLP experiments  
  - End‑to‑end mini projects with evaluation and visualizations.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Language: Python  
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries (per notebook, may vary):  
  - `pandas` – data handling  
  - `numpy` – numerical operations  
  - `scikit-learn` – ML models and utilities  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (planned) – visualizations.
